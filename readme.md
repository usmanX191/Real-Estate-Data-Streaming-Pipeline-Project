# Real Estate Data Streaming & Analytics Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Real Estate Data Streaming & Analytics Pipeline** built with a variety of technologies, including **Python**, **Bright Data**, **Apache Kafka**, **Cassandra**, and **Power BI**. The pipeline is designed to extract real-time property data, process it efficiently, store large datasets, and visualize key insights for market analysis.

### Key Technologies:
- **Python**
- **Bright Data (Web Scraping)**
- **Apache Kafka**
- **Apache Spark**
- **Cassandra**
- **Power BI**

### Components:
1. **Bright Data (WebSocket Data Extraction)**:
   - Real-time property data is extracted using Bright Dataâ€™s WebSocket API.
   
2. **Apache Kafka (Data Streaming)**:
   - The data is streamed in real-time to **Apache Kafka** using a master-worker architecture built with **Docker**.
   
3. **Apache Spark (Data Processing)**:
   - **Apache Spark** processes the streamed data to ensure it's efficiently handled and transformed for storage.
   
4. **Cassandra (Data Storage)**:
   - The processed data is stored in **Cassandra**, a distributed NoSQL database optimized for large-scale real-time data.

5. **Power BI (Visualization)**:
   - **Power BI** is used to create visual dashboards, helping analyze property trends and extract valuable insights from the data.
